# CITS3403 Group Project

## Quick start

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python server.py
```

# Key Features:
## Challenges and Requests:
Users can post challenges for others to complete or respond to requests, earning points and recognition.
## Points and Currency: 
Points earned from completing tasks double as in-app currency, which can be used to access exclusive content, participate in special events, or commission art requests from other users.
## Leaderboards:
Compete with others and climb the overall leaderboards by earning points and completing challenges. Additionally, each request submission has its own leaderboard organized by the user who submitted the request.
## Showcase: 
In addition to challenges, users can showcase non-challenge related submissions and commission artwork using their earned currency.
